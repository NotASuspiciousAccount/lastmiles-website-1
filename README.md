# lastmiles-website

This repository will include a database, backend server, and the frontend for a web interface made for the food rescue organization Last Miles.
This website will offer an interface for food pantry agencies to claim food from a stress load, which will be uploaded to Last Miles' food rescue hero app.
In addition, last miles will be able to upload stress loads through the website that will then be made available to the aforementioned agencies.
Email notifications will be sent out by the backend.
